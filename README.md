## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Singapore, a small nation of over 5.5 million, faces a shortage of nursing professionals due to the population growth, rapid aging, increasing burden from chronic diseases, and less people taking up the profession. For those who are already in the profession, the working conditions, fatigue, distraction and interruption while performing their work can contribute to the increase in stress level, and affects the cognitive, and decision-making abilities to the point that it begins to threaten the safety of the patients. As such, any effort to reduce the stress and improving the working conditions for the nursing professional is always going to be viewed and received in the positive light.

Our Hey Nurse! an intelligent Nurse Call system has been conceived and designed for nurses to provide a high standard and quality of care at a much lower level of stress.  A voice activated listening device build on Mycroft open-source technology is used to capture the audio input from the patient. One of the highlights of Hey Nurse! is the machine learning capability that allows for automated prioritization of patient’s request in a hospital ward. By presenting the patients’ requests on a minimalistic but yet user-friendly nurse-dashboard, Hey Nurse! is meant to assist the nurses to plan and review their actions before attending to the patients. At the same time, nurses with the right level of experience can be assigned to attend to the various requests. The collected data accumulated over time by the Hey Nurse! system can assist the hospital to plan their nursing resources more effectively and to optimise the composition of their nursing teams.

This first iteration of Hey Nurse! is a prototype that serves as a proof-of-concept and future improvements include adding functionalities such as extracting emotion information out of the patient audio input, building two-ways communication between nurses and patients, and many more. Refer to Section 6.2 for more details.
